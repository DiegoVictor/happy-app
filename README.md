# Installing
Easy peasy lemon squeezy:
```
$ yarn
```
Or:
```
$ npm install
```
> Was installed and configured the [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) and [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) to keep the code clean and patterned.


# Usage
To start the app run:
```
$ yarn start
```
Or:
```
$ npm run start
```
> This project was built with [Expo](https://expo.io), to know how to run it in your phone see [Expo client for iOS and Android](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v37.0.0/get-started/installation/#2-mobile-app-expo-client-for-ios) and in your computer see [Running the Expo client on your computer](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v37.0.0/get-started/installation/#running-the-expo-client-on-your-computer).

## OS
This app was tested only with Android through USB connection and [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) (Emulator), is strongly recommended to use the same operational system, but of course you can use an emulator or a real device connected through wifi or USB.
